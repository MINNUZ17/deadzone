## 💡 Project Idea
Students often study without knowing when they are actually productive.  
DeadZone analyzes study time, focus level, and distractions to give data-driven insights about:
- Best study time
- Dead zones (low productivity)
- Personalized study advice

---

## ✨ Features
- Multiple student profiles  
- Add study sessions (time, focus, distraction)  
- Productivity analysis by time slots  
- Best study time & dead zone detection  
- Visual analytics using charts  
- AI-style study advice & timetable  
- Responsive and modern UI  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- Each study session is analyzed using:
  
  `(Effective Time × Focus Level) / Total Duration`

- Productivity is averaged for time slots:
  - Early Morning
  - Morning
  - Afternoon
  - Evening
  - Night

- Highest score → Best Study Time  
- Lowest score → Dead Zone
